<p>You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Python
### 解题思路
股票买卖的思路是低买高卖。但是这题是可以进行无数比交易。那么最大收益是能赚的钱都要赚到，就是把所有第二天价格比第一天价格高的差值加起来。

### 复杂度分析
**时间复杂度**：$O(N)$。N是prices的长度。

**空间复杂度**：$O(1)$。
### 解题代码
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return profit
```
